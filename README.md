## About the Project

The Flight Analyzer program allows users to calculate the duration of a flight between two locations. It considers the departure time, arrival time, and 3-letter IATA codes for the departure and arrival locations. The program performs the following tasks:

- Takes input for departure location and time.
- Validates the input to ensure that the time is in a valid format.
- Takes input for arrival location and time.
- Validates the input for arrival time in a similar manner.
- Calculates and displays the flight time difference in hours, minutes, and seconds.

This project serves as a practical example of working with time and struct data types in C.
